# Real-Time Code Editor
The Real-Time Code Editor is an advanced web application designed for seamless collaboration among developers. 
It enables multiple users to edit code simultaneously in real time, fostering efficient teamwork and rapid iteration cycles. Built with robust features tailored for modern development workflows, it enhances productivity and code quality through its intuitive interface and powerful functionalities.

## Features
- **Real-time Editing**
Real-time editing ensures that any changes made by a user on a file are immediately propagated and visible to all other connected users. This is achieved using WebSocket technology (such as Socket.io) to establish a persistent connection between the clients and the server. As a result, all participants can see live updates as they happen, enabling seamless collaboration and quick feedback.

- **Syntax Highlighting**
Syntax highlighting enhances code readability by applying different colors and styles to different components of the code based on their syntax and semantics. This feature supports multiple programming languages, ensuring that developers can easily distinguish between keywords, variables, comments, etc. This improves code comprehension and reduces errors caused by syntax mistakes.

- **Collaborative Editing**
Collaborative editing allows multiple users to work on the same file simultaneously without conflicts. The application manages changes in real time by merging edits intelligently and resolving conflicts automatically or through user interaction. This feature is crucial for teams working together on projects, enabling them to see each other's changes instantly and work together efficiently.

- **Code Formatting**
Code formatting automatically adjusts the indentation, spacing, and overall structure of code to conform to predefined style guidelines or user preferences. This helps maintain consistency across the codebase, improves readability, and reduces time spent on manual formatting. Users can customize formatting rules or choose from preset configurations to suit their coding standards.
